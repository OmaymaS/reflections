Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

--------------------
git remote
	-show remote 

git remote "title"
	-create and name remote

git remote add "title" "url"
	-push an existing repository from the command line

git remote -v

git push "title" "branch title-local"

git pull"title" "branch title-local"
