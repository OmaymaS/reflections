How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It shows the lines where the differences between the versions exist.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It enables me to have access to the old versions and rollback to any of them.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: I can choose exactly the commit point after a logical change.
cons: I might forget to create a commit for a long interval.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because sometimes files are inter-related and changes affect all of them simultaneously. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git  log can show the history ofcommits, and git diff shows the insertions/deletions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
